/**
 * IccVizModel — data-first profile visualization model.
 *
 * Computes a profile's visualizations — tone curves, the CIE 1931 chromaticity
 * chart, named/colorant a*b* and xy scatters, and the nD CLUT lattice — and
 * *returns the underlying data* rather than finished drawings:
 *
 *   - Graph visualizations (tone curves, chromaticity, named-colour scatters)
 *     come back as Graph: 2-D point series plus axis range hints, so the caller
 *     draws/rasterizes them in its own look-and-feel. NO raster is produced for
 *     graph types.
 *   - Genuine images (the nD CLUT lattice) come back as Raster: the flattened,
 *     ICC-normalized CLUT samples plus geometry — the caller decides how to
 *     colour-manage/display them.
 *
 * Series carry a role: Primary (the profile's own data — primaries, white,
 * curve, named colours) vs Hint (reference geometry the caller may draw or
 * ignore — spectral locus, planckian curve, wavelength labels, chroma circles,
 * identity line). No ticks/grid are shipped: those are a caller-side decision;
 * only an axis range *hint* is provided.
 *
 * Design intent: this file depends ONLY on IccProfLib + spectralLocus.hpp + the
 * C++ standard library — no embind, no nlohmann, no PDF/TIFF writers — so it is
 * self-contained and portable between callers (CLI, browser/WASM, tests).
