/**
 * IccVizMath — small shared colour-math helpers for the visualization model.
 *
 * The pure scalar conversions the visualizations need: XYZ→xy chromaticity
 * projection and the Kang et al. planckian-locus approximation.
 *
 * They live in one header so the math — especially approxPlanck()'s polynomial
 * constants — has a single source. The functions are header-only (inline) and
 * depend only on the ICC scalar types, so the header carries no link dependency.
